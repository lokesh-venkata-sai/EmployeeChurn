# Employee Churn Prediction

## Introduction
Employee churn significantly impacts organizations by the departure of intellectual assets. This project aims to predict employee churn by analyzing various factors like age, 
tenure, pay, job satisfaction, and more, using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Final Deliverables
The core of this project is a web application that enables managers to understand and predict factors causing employee churn. Features include:
- A dashboard showing potential future employee churn.
- Analysis based on historical data of employees who have left.
- Predictive insights into reasons behind potential churns, allowing for preemptive action.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and predictive modeling using libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- **Flask**: Serves as the web framework for the application.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing employee data and churn predictions.
- **Git**: Version control system for code management.

## Work Done
- Predictive analysis using Gradient Boosting Classifier for identifying potential churn.
- Web application development integrating predictive models.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand key factors influencing churn.

## Challenges Faced
- Reducing prediction errors.
- Visualizing complex data within the web application.
- Integrating the web application with the data model and database.

## Project Outcome
This project provides actionable insights for managers to reduce employee churn by addressing the root causes, thereby improving job satisfaction and organizational commitment.
